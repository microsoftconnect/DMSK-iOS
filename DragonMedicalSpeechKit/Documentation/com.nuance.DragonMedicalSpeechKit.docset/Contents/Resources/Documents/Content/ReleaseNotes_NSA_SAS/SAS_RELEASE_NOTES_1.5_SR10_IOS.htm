        <h1>Release Notes for 360 | SpeechAnywhere Services 1.5 Service Release 10 (iOS edition)</h1>
        <h2>Solved issues</h2>
        <p>A command that is added several times with an identical name and spoken form is only sent to the SAS&#160;Server once. [PSP00073710]</p>
        <p>The <code>UISearchBar</code> view can now be speech-enabled. [PSP00069814]</p>
        <p>Auto Layout views can now be speech-enabled. [PSP00073577]</p>
        <p>If the text length returned by the <code>NUSATextControl</code> method <code>vuiTextInRange</code> is different from the queried range, a warning message is now logged to the debug output during simulator debugging. [PSP00074722]</p>
        <p>The accessory view is now correctly restored when the <b>What You Can Say</b> page is closed. [PSP00072109]</p>
        <p>The Nuance flame icon and the red border are now displayed correctly in custom integration applications with storyboards. [PSP00063794]</p>
        <p>The <b>What You Can Say</b> page now opens properly if the device is iOS 7.x-based and  the <b>What You Can Say</b> page is initially displayed in landscape mode. [PSP00073675]</p>
        <p>Special characters in concept names are correctly ignored and no longer lead to missing recognition results. For concept names to be usable for field navigation, they should only contain alphabetic letters, no special characters or numbers. [PSP00073570]</p>
        <p>In very rare circumstances, the iOS SDK threw undocumented exceptions which might lead to an integrating application terminating unexpectedly. This has been resolved. [PSP00074216]</p>
        <h2>Solved issues in Service Release 6</h2>
        <p>Following the recent Apple iOS security issue (<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT6147">http://support.apple.com/kb/HT6147</a>) we conducted a thorough review of the 360 | SpeechAnywhere Services iOS SDK and identified a potential security issue that is not addressed by iOS 7.0.6. This security issue could make an application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. At this time we have no reason to suspect this vulnerability has been exploited; however, we recommend that all partners upgrade to this new SAS SDK to ensure the highest levels of security. [PSP00073512]</p>
        <p>Be aware that this issue applies to all iOS editions of 360 | SpeechAnywhere Services (1.2, 1.3 and 1.4). It is Nuance policy to only provide service releases for the most recent major version; if you are using an older version please upgrade to version 1.5 in order to benefit from all fixes and improvements. </p>
        <p class="note"><span class="important">Important:</span> Make sure to upgrade and recompile your integration and distribute to your customers as soon as possible.</p>
        <h2>Important information</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>In iOS 7 applications microphone access must be permitted. If a user unintentionally disallows microphone access for an SAS-enabled application, this can be re-enabled; to enable microphone access, go to <b>Settings</b>, <b>Privacy</b>, <b>Microphone</b>. Note: The application is restarted automatically when this setting is changed.</li>
            <li>360 | SpeechAnywhere Services 1.5 Server is compatible with client versions 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Known issues</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>The <code>SpokenText</code> parameter in the <code>CommandRecognized</code> event is empty in command mode. [PSP00062085]</li>
            <li>If you upgrade your MacOS X workstation from a version earlier than 10.7 to version 10.7 (or higher) dictation will not work on iOS 6 in the Simulator. <b>Workaround:</b> Install the workstation cleanly with MacOS X 10.7 (or higher). [PSP00063580]</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>*End-of-life: third party environments</h2>
        <p>Support for third party environments is only valid as long as they are supported by the corresponding vendor and might be subject to other restrictions. Please contact Nuance Technical Support for details. For more information, see the documentation delivered with the third party product and supporting Nuance documentation.</p>
        <p>When support by the vendor has stopped, Nuance will continue support if an issue is specific to the Nuance solution, within the limitations of the vendor’s end-of-life and Nuance's policy. This means that issues that are a combination of the vendor’s component and the Nuance solution cannot be supported.</p>
