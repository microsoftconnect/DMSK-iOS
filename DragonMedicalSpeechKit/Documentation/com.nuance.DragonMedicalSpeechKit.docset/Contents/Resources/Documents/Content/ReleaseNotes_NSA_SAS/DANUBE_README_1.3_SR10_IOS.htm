        <h1>Release Notes - 360 | SpeechAnywhere Services 1.3 Service Release 10</h1>
        <p>This is a service release for 360 | SpeechAnywhere Services iOS edition.</p>
        <p>This service release is cumulative and contains all changes to previous service releases.</p>
        <h2>New features</h2>
        <p>An <code>abortRecording</code> method has been added; it discards all unprocessed utterances and pending recognition results. </p>
        <p>armv7s architecture (iPhone 5) is now supported.        </p>
        <p>A new skinable GUI&#160;element has been added: the speech control. It is an alternative to the speech bar and fully documented in the SDK help.        </p>
        <p>The minimum requirements have been updated to Xcode 4.5.        </p>
        <p>Your custom VUI controller integration can now be notified when the speech bar is shown or hidden via the <code>NUSACustomVuiControllerDelegate</code> methods:</p>
        <p class="compact2"><code>speechBarDidShow</code> </p>
        <p class="indent2"><code>speechBarDidHide</code> </p>
        <p class="indent2">Information on the size and position of the speech bar is also returned.</p>
        <p>The class that implements the <code>NUSATextControl</code> protocol must also implement two messages from the <code>UIResponder</code> class:</p>
        <p class="indent2">To enable 360 | SpeechAnywhere Services to determine which <code>NUSATextControl</code> has the speech focus; for example, where recognized text should be inserted, implement the message <code>(BOOL)isFirstResponder</code>.</p>
        <p class="indent2">To enable 360 | SpeechAnywhere Services to actively set the speech focus as a result of voice command navigation, implement the message <code>(BOOL)becomeFirstResponder</code>.</p>
        <p class="indent2">If  the custom control class derives from a responder class that can become first responder, these  messages are already available and  do not  have to be implemented.</p>
        <p class="indent2">360 | SpeechAnywhere Services will not be able to detect if the first responder is changed within an utterance unless the <code>NUSATextControlDidBeginEditingNotification</code> is posted when the first responder for recognition results is manually changed (for example, by tapping on a speech-enabled custom control). The notification must be posted to the process's default notification center. The notification object must be the custom control that has just become first responder.</p>
        <h2>Solved issues</h2>
        <p>The speech bar is now positioned correctly in landscape orientation.        </p>
        <p>Sessions can now be closed cleanly even if recognition results are pending.        </p>
        <p>The stability of the custom control interface has been improved.        </p>
        <p>What to do when your application enters the background has been documented.</p>
        <p>The speech bar is now always displayed after changing views. </p>
        <p>In custom controls, the recognition result is now displayed in the order it was dictated in. </p>
        <p class="compact">Custom control integration of a web view:</p>
        <p class="compact2">The speech bar is now shown correctly with a split keyboard on an iPad device.      </p>
        <p class="compact2">The speech bar now only reacts to input when it is visible.</p>
        <p class="compact2">The speech bar is now shown correctly before recording is started.</p>
        <h2>Previous service release information</h2>
        <h3>Service Release 5 (iOS 6 support)</h3>
        <p>360 | SpeechAnywhere Services 1.3 Service Release 5 has been tested with iOS 6 Golden Master.</p>
        <p>Recording works on devices with iOS 6 installed; it does not work on simulators running iOS 6.</p>
        <h2>Known issues</h2>
        <p>If a storyboard-based application is speech enabled, the VuiController is not always initialized automatically (the speech bar and the Nuance flame are not displayed in the view or are positioned in the wrong place). <b>Workaround:</b> </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Overload the <code>viewDidAppear:</code> method in your view controller implementation.</li>
            <li value="2">In the overloaded <code>viewDidAppear:</code> method call the VuiControllerâ€™s <code> synchronizeWithView</code>  method.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When integrating HTML controls in a webView via the <code>NUSACustomVuiController</code>, focus handling might not work correctly unless you are using iOS 6.</p>
        <p>When the speech control is placed on a toolbar, that is placed at the top of the screen, together with other buttons it is 1 pixel lower than the other buttons. Be aware that this might change in the next release.</p>
