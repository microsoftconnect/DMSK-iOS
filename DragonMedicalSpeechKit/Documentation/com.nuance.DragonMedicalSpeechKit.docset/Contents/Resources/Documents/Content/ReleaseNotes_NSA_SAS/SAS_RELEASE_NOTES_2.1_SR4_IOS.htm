        <h1>Release Notes for 360&#160;|&#160;SpeechAnywhere Services 2.1 Service Release 4 (iOS edition)</h1>
        <h2>Solved issues in service release 4</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The <span class="command">undo that</span> voice command no longer moves the cursor to the wrong place. [DNB-4944]</li>
            <li>Application commands defined using an escaped quotation mark (<code>\"</code>) no longer cause an error. [DNB-4759]</li>
            <li>Calling <code>synchronizeWithView</code> from the event handler for <code>vuiControllerDidFinishProcessing</code> or <code>vuiControllerDidFinishProcessingForView</code> no longer causes the application to stop responding. [DNB-4760]</li>
            <li>The first speech-enabled control no longer automatically receives the UI focus when the VuiController is opened and synchronized. [DNB-5080]</li>
            <li><span class="path">libNuanceSpeechAnywhere.a</span> no longer embeds CocoaLumberjack. [DNB-5026]</li>
            <li>Text-To-Speech no longer causes a memory leak. [DNB-5044]</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Important information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>360 | SpeechAnywhere Services 2.1 (iOS edition) is compatible with server versions 1.6, 2.0 and 2.1.</li>
            <li>360 | SpeechAnywhere Services 2.1 (iOS edition) will not work correctly when used with server version 1.5.</li>
            <li>360 | SpeechAnywhere Services 2.1 Server is compatible with client versions 1.5, 1.6, 2.0 and 2.1.</li>
            <li>With Xcode 7/iOS 9 the bitcode option is enabled by default. The SpeechAnywhere SDK is not built with bitcode on; an existing SpeechAnywhere integration will not compile out of the box in Xcode 7. The <b>Enable Bitcode</b> option must be set to <b>No</b> manually by the integrator. </li>
            <li>For on-premises deployments of SpeechAnywhere Servers with iOS 9, the connection to the SpeechAnywhere Server will only work if the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/technotes/App-Transport-Security-Technote/">App Transport Security</a> requirements are met. Unencrypted HTTP connections to servers will no longer work. </li>
            <li>Speech enabling text controls with the <code>userInteractionEnabled</code> or <code>editable</code> property set to <code>NO</code> is no longer supported.</li>
            <li>SpeechAnywhere Analytics has been renamed to Dragon Medical Analytics.</li>

            <li>iOS 9 is now supported.</li>
            <li>A SWIFT sample is now available for the iOS SDK.</li>
            <li>The integrator can now actively improve speech recognition; notifying SpeechAnywhere about the document correction state as well as the finalized version via the support functionality for document workflows. For more information, see: 'Support functionality for document workflows' in the SpeechAnywhere SDK help.</li>
        </ul>

Make sure the simulator is configured so that either the <b>Simulator</b>, <b>Hardware</b>, <b>Keyboard</b>, <b>Connect Hardware Keyboard</b> option is not selected, or the <b>Toggle Software Keyboard</b> option is also set. [PSP00077597]</li>
            <li>A 16-byte memory leak occurs in the SDK each time a session is closed. [DNB-4846]</li>

        <h3>*End-of-life: third party environments</h3>
        <p>Support for third party environments is only valid as long as they are supported by the corresponding vendor and might be subject to other restrictions. Please contact Nuance Technical Support for details. For more information, see the documentation delivered with the third party product and supporting Nuance documentation.</p>
        <p>When support by the vendor has stopped, Nuance will continue support if an issue is specific to the Nuance solution, within the limitations of the vendor’s end-of-life and Nuance's policy. This means that issues that are a combination of the vendor’s component and the Nuance solution cannot be supported.</p>
