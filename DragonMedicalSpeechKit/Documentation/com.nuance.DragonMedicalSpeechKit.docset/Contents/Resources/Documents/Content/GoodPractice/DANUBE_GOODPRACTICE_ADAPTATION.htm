        <h1>Reducing recognition error rates</h1>
        <p>Apps can help their users achieve low recognition error rates by following these integration guidelines. Be aware that certain bad integration patterns can make it impossible for the system to adjust to the user's way of speaking and therefore cause increased recognition error rates.</p>
        <p>Speech recognition user profiles consist of various models that represent a user's way of speaking.</p>
        <p>When a user is using the system for the first time, initial models are created for that user. Over time, the system adapts these models to the specifics of the user's way of speaking. Via this process, the profile is 'personalized' for the user, reducing recognition errors.</p>
        <p>An essential element of this adaptation process is learning based on the user correcting errors. If a word is incorrectly recognized and subsequently corrected by the user, the system can learn from the mistake and correction and avoid future errors. As this is a statistical process, not every correction will immediately result in the error never occurring again. However, in general, error rates are reduced over time if recognition errors are corrected and these corrections are made available to the system.</p>
        <h2>The adaptation process in <span class="mc-variable DocLoc.DM_SK variable">Dragon Medical SpeechKit</span></h2>
        <p>To make corrections available to the system, <span class="mc-variable DocLoc.DM_SK variable">Dragon Medical SpeechKit</span> regularly sends text from speech-enabled edit controls to the server, where it's fed into the backend adaptation processes.</p>
        <p>As the user might edit the same word several times, only the 'final' text state is considered for adaptation. The 'final' text state is the text content of the edit controls at the time when the <code>VuiController</code> is closed.</p>
        <h2>Application logic - what you must do</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure to close the <code>VuiController</code> when the document or form the user is editing is closed. Use a new <code>VuiController</code> instance each time a document or form is newly created or loaded.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="indent2">Don't simply clear out the edit controls and reuse the same VuiController for several documents or forms.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure a user's text corrections are visible to <span class="mc-variable DocLoc.DM_SK variable">Dragon Medical SpeechKit</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="indent2">Don't clear the text or remove edit controls before closing the <code>VuiController</code>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep the <code>VuiController</code> open and connected to the edit controls while the user is dictating and correcting.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="indent2">Don't separate editing and correction from dictation in your app. Don't close the <code>VuiController</code> after dictation and then have the user edit text in a non-speech-enabled edit control. Don't implement the custom edit control interface in a way that hides a user's corrections. Don't implement the custom edit control interface in a way that overlays multiple edit controls onto a single custom edit control.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Avoid programmatic text changes to dictated text, because changes to dictated text might be interpreted as manual corrections by the user.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="indent2">Don't do text post-processing in edit controls while they're still speech-enabled. Don't replace dictated words by other text (e.g. to realize a feature such as 'normals expansion'); use <span class="mc-variable DocLoc.DM_SK variable">Dragon Medical SpeechKit</span> auto-texts or application commands instead.</p>
